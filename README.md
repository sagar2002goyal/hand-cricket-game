#INTRODUCTION
This game is a tribute to one of my favorite childhood games Hand Cricket. I have played this game for more than a decade, and I am pretty sure everyone in the Indian subcontinent would have heard or played this game at least once. Playing this game in person required a lot of coordination as well as quick mental math to keep track of runs and wickets, and did I mention that it was fun to play? So to bring back those childhood memories, I have created the Hand Cricket App.
#How To Play
If you aren't familiar with cricket or hand cricket, I highly suggest you to take a look at the rules of cricket and hand cricket at the bottom of this page. Go on, I am waiting. Now that you have read about the rules (if you still haven't , READ IT) and know all about wickets, overs and runs , let's get started. Okay, okay for the people who are too lazy, let me explain it briefly.

Runs- This is a unit of scoring. Basically like 'points' for people with no cricketing background.
Wickets- This is a really good way to prevent opponents from scoring. It is sort of like 'lives' in a game. If you pick all the wickets, then the opponent can't score any runs.
Overs- This is a limiting factor for the game. If you don't get all the wickets of the opponent, the only thing that stops the opponent from scoring is the overs. When the opponent has completed batting all the overs, they can't score anymore. An over has 6 balls and you can choose the number of overs you want to play in Hand Cricket. If you decide to choose the 'test' option, then there will be unlimited overs. This means that you will have to get all wickets of the opponent to prevent him from scoring.
